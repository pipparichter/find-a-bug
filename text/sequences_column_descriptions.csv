column_name,data_type,description,primary
gene_id,str,"The gene identifier, consisting of the the first word of the original FASTA sequence header followed by an underscore followed by the ordinal ID of the protein",True
seq,str,"The amino acid sequence of the geneâ€™s coding region",False
genome_id,str,"The GTDB accession of the genome to which the gene belongs",False
nt_start,int,"The location of the start of the gene in the genome",False
nt_stop,int,"The location of the end of the gene in the genome",False
gc_cont,float,"The GC content of the gene",False
reverse,bool,"Whether or not the gene is read from the reverse strand",False
start_type,str,"TThe sequence of the start codon (usually ATG, GTG, or TTG). If the gene has no start codon, this field will be labeled Edge",False
rbs_motif,str,"The RBS binding motif detected by Prodigal",False
rbs_spacer,str,"The RBS spacer detected by Prodigal",False
prodigal_unique_id,str,"An identifier for each gene consisting of the ordinal ID of the sequence and an ordinal ID of that gene within the sequence (separated by an underscore)",False
partial,str,"An indicator of if a gene runs off the edge of a sequence or into a gap. 0 indicates the gene has a true boundary, whereas a 1 indicates the gene is incomplete at that edge, e.g. 01 means a gene is partial at the right boundary, 11 indicates both edges are incomplete, 00 indicates a complete gene with a start and stop codon",False
